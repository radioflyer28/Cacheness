# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-29)

**Core value:** Applications can store and retrieve data reliably through one backend-neutral lifecycle, with caching policy layered above storage without compromising integrity or cleanup correctness.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Compatibility and Security Baseline

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Compatibility and Security Baseline) — EXECUTING
Plan: 11 of 12
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-29 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- `BlobStore` is the canonical payload-plus-metadata lifecycle owner; `UnifiedCache` owns cache policy only.
- `SqlCache` remains a separate subsystem, and supported public APIs stay available through compatibility adapters.
- V1 supports same-backend migration plus an explicit rebuild for incompatible or cross-backend data.
- Direct `BlobStore` integrity failures are typed exceptions; `UnifiedCache` may translate them into separately recorded misses.
- AWS S3 semantics are authoritative; compatible services are supported only where explicitly verified.
- [Phase 01]: CacheReason uses stable lower-snake-case string values in typed error contexts.
- [Phase 01]: SQL cache classes remain importable without optional dependencies; construction reports actionable guidance.
- [Phase 01]: CacheStorageConfig preserves authored paths; storage boundaries resolve them at runtime.
- [Phase 01]: FilesystemBlobBackend accepts only strict opaque IDs; Plan 03 owns logical-key encoding.
- [Phase 01]: Resolved storage roots are anchored once and managed descendants are revalidated per operation.
- [Phase 01]: SqlCache strict mode stages all missing-range frames and raises one typed completeness error before storage if any range fails or is empty.
- [Phase 01]: SqlCache best-effort mode is explicit and returns SqlCacheResult with immutable ordered failure records.
- [Phase 01]: Custom gap fallback is best-effort-only, while bulk-to-row upsert uses an observable savepoint-backed fallback.
- [Phase 01]: The independent corpus validator owns the exact eight-fixture matrix and accepts only staged manifest prefixes.
- [Phase 01]: Legacy raw fixtures are verified through bounded framing and direct decompressed-byte comparison without historical readers or metadata evaluation.
- [Phase 01]: Generated evidence records equal source/copy SHA-256 values plus an independent manifest digest for provenance.
- [Phase 01]: High-level handlers serialize in private stages and deserialize only from a live private snapshot copied once through ManagedFileOps.
- [Phase 01]: BlobStore keys and UnifiedCache prefixes remain exact public metadata while payload paths use versioned length-framed SHA-256 identifiers.
- [Phase 01]: Unsafe locator preflight covers complete high-level operation sets before reads, cleanup, metadata mutation, or result exposure.
- [Phase 01]: The independent validator, rather than fixture discovery, owns the exact signed and unsigned split-map schema and accumulated corpus prefix.
- [Phase 01]: Signed split-map evidence uses a fixed, disclosed test-only 32-byte HMAC input and records a distinct wrong-key verification failure expectation in provenance.
- [Phase 01]: Legacy raw-array frames remain read-only compatibility input and are parsed through bounded tuple metadata plus exact byte validation.
- [Phase 01]: New ordinary arrays use native NPZ with pickle disabled; no Cacheness raw-array writer remains.
- [Phase 01]: Object arrays require explicit signing, integrity verification, unsigned-entry rejection, and snapshot authorization before ObjectHandler.
- [Phase 01]: query_meta validates the complete filter-key set before any backend/session access and exposes invalid fields as typed errors.
- [Phase 01]: query_meta binds SQLite JSON paths and values separately while retaining raw filters and legacy serialized-string compatibility.
- [Phase 01]: Historical SQLite fixture inspection is read-only and records the exact legacy schema, data-version invariant, and source/copy digests.
- [Phase 01]: The 0.3.13 decorator compatibility path accepts one recorded candidate and derived storage key; it never scans metadata.
- [Phase 01]: Current JSON fixture provenance records one exact unified key that the independent validator recomputes and looks up directly.
- [Phase 01]: Current SQLite control provenance records the exact denormalized schema, metadata_json absence, and read-only data_version through a copied read-only URI.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 planning must determine the supported legacy read window from released fixtures.
- Phase 3 planning must derive tombstone retention and orphan grace defaults from fault/crash testing.
- Phase 8 performance and coverage thresholds must be finalized from measured baselines rather than estimates.
